    description:
      "A 160-190 km trek circling the Annapurna Massif, this classic route combines subtropical forests, Buddhist villages, high alpine passes, and dramatic mountain scenery. The trek crosses the challenging Thorong La Pass at 5,416m and offers one of Nepal's most diverse hiking experiences.",
    content:
      "The Annapurna Circuit is celebrated for its dramatic diversity—trekkers experience every climate zone from subtropical to alpine desert within 16-18 days. The route passes through numerous ethnic communities (Hindus, Buddhists, Tibetans), offering rich cultural immersion alongside mountaineering challenge.",
    whatToExpect:
      "Expect substantial daily elevation changes, diverse landscapes changing dramatically every few days, tea-house accommodations, cultural encounters with Gurung, Magar, and Tibetan communities, challenging high-altitude terrain, and unpredictable weather. The Thorong La Pass section is technically difficult with early morning starts required.",
    highlights: [
      "Thorong La Pass - 5,416m dramatic high pass with stunning views and thrilling descent",
      "Manang Village - Tibetan-influenced settlement at 3,519m with excellent acclimatization opportunity",
      "Muktinath Temple - Sacred Hindu-Buddhist pilgrimage site at 3,710m with natural gas flames",
      "Marpha - Beautifully preserved Thani village known for apple orchards and local spirits",
      "Annapurna Base Camp - Alternative trek combining Annapurna views without high passes",

    history:
      "The Annapurna region has been an important trade route between Nepal and Tibet for centuries. The circuit became a trekking route in the 1970s-80s as infrastructure developed. The region gained prominence after Maurice Herzog's 1950 Annapurna I first ascent—the first 8,000m peak summited. The trek is now one of the most popular in the world, though the 1950 disasters during early mountaineering attempts left deep cultural marks on local communities.",
    bestTime:
      "Late March to May (Spring): Clear skies establish by April-May, temperatures 10-20°C at lower elevations, rhododendrons blooming, but some high passes may have snow. Mid-September to October (Autumn): Crisp, clear air, stable weather, temperatures 0-15°C, optimal conditions. November-December and February-March possible but cold. Avoid June-August (monsoon—dangerous river crossings, leeches, limited visibility) and January (extreme cold on high passes).",
    gettingThere:
      "Bus from Kathmandu to Besisahar (7-8 hours, NPR 600-1000) marks unofficial starting point, though most trek from Chame (8 hours) or fly to Pokhara then drive. Alternative: Fly Kathmandu to Pokhara (30 minutes) then drive/bus to Besisahar (3 hours). Southern approach via Pokhara and Nayapul; northern exit via Jomsom flight or road descent.",
